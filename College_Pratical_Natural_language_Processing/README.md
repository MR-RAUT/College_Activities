### 🛠️ Practical List

Here’s what you’ll explore in this repository:

1. **📥 Text Tokenization and Word Frequency**  
   - Convert text into tokens and compute word frequency distributions.  

2. **📖 Synonyms and Antonyms Using WordNet**  
   - Leverage WordNet to find synonyms and antonyms for any word.  

3. **🔗 Bigram and Trigram Language Models**  
   - Build bigram and trigram models, and generate regular expressions for text.  

4. **📚 Lemmatization, Stemming, and POS Tagging**  
   - Normalize text using lemmatization and stemming, and tag parts of speech using the Penn Treebank set.  

5. **🤖 HMM for POS Tagging and Chunking**  
   - Implement a Hidden Markov Model for tagging and create a chunker for text segmentation.  

6. **📍 Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   - Identify entities like names, places, and organizations using NER models.  

7. **🔍 Semantic Role Labeling**  
   - Identify the roles of words in sentences (e.g., subject, action, and object).  

8. **📝 Text Classification using Logistic Regression**  
   - Build a text classifier for categorizing text into predefined labels.  

9. **🎬 Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Classify movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis models.  

10. **🔁 RNN for Sequence Labeling**  
    - Use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to label sequences in text data.  

11. **📌 POS Tagging using LSTM**  
    - Implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for Part-of-Speech tagging.  

12. **🌐 Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using LSTM/GRU**  
    - Resolve ambiguities in the meanings of polysemy words using deep learning.
